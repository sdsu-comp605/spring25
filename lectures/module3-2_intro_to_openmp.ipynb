    "#### Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP-4.0 added the `omp simd` construct, which is a portable way to request that the compiler vectorize code. An example of a reason why a compiler might fail to vectorize code is **pointer aliasing**, which we investigate below.\n",
    "\n",

    "gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-all -c triad.c -o triad\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we have used the `-O2` optimization flag, together with the `-ftree-vectorize` vectorization flag and the `-fopt-info-all` logging info flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of all [optimization flags](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html) see this reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- gcc autovectorization starts at `-O3` or if you use `-ftree-vectorize`\n",
    "- options such as [`-fopt-info`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Developer-Options.html#index-fopt-info) give useful diagnostics, but are compiler-dependent and sometimes referring to assembly is useful\n",
    "- you can also use `man gcc` for the manual page of `gcc` and search with `/`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Pointer aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)#Aliased_pointers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this valid code? What is `x` after this call?\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "double x[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
    "triad(2, x+1, x, 10., x);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliasing can occur in any language that can refer to one location in memory with more than one name (for example, with pointers). This is a common problem with functions that accept pointer arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "C allows memory to overlap arbitrarily. You can inform the compiler of this using the [`restrict`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict) qualifier (C99/C11; `__restrict` or `__restrict__` work with most C++ and [`CUDA` compilers](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-optimize-pointer-aliasing/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `restrict` qualifier, a programmer hints to the compiler that for the lifetime of the pointer, no other pointer will be used to access the object to which it points. This allows the compiler to make optimizations (for example, vectorization) that would not otherwise have been possible. With the `restrict` qualifier, the compiler is allowed to assume that the qialified pointers point to different locations and updating the memory location referenced by one pointer will not affect the memory locations referenced by the other pointers. The programmer, _not_ the compiler, is responsible for ensuring that the pointers do not point to identical locations. The compiler can e.g. rearrange the code, first loading all memory locations, then performing the operations before committing the results back to memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} ../c_codes/module3-2/triad-restrict.c\n",
    ":language: c\n",
    ":linenos: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compile this code with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gcc -O2 -march=native -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-all -c triad-restrict.c -o triad-restrict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we've added the [`-march=native`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html) compilation flag that generates instructions specific for the machine the code is being compiled on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how there is no more `loop versioned for vectorization because of possible aliasing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of checking for aliasing can grow combinatorially in the number of arrays being processed, leading to many loop variants and/or preventing vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Warnings\n",
    "The `-Wrestrict` flag (included in `-Wall`) can catch some programming errors. Let's see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{literalinclude} ../c_codes/module3-2/triad-foo.c\n",
    ":language: c\n",
    ":linenos: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compile it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gcc -O2 -Wall -c triad-foo.c -o triad-foo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The powers of `-Wrestrict` are limited, however, and (as of `gcc 13.3.0` at the time of writing) do not even catch\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void foo(double *x) {\n",
    "  triad(2, x+1, x, 10, x);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check the assembly\n",
    "To make sure that your code is vectorized properly or not affected by aliasing, you can check the assembly code with `objdump`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "objdump -d --prefix-addresses -M intel triad-restrict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the assembly qualitatively different without `restrict` (in which case the compiler “versions” the loop)? Check it yourself by inspecting the output of `objdump` with `triad`."
