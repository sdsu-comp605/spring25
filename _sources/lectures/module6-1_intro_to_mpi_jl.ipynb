    "\n",
    "Recap on MPI so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each process executes its own program with its own data.\n",
    "- Each process can communicate with every other process through messages (chunks of binary data, generally arrays of primitive data types like `int`, `double`, etc..)\n",
    "- Messages can be _point-to-point_ (between only two processes) or _collective_ such as _broadcasts_ (one to all) and _reductions_ (all to one).\n",
    "- Though in principle each process can execute a unique program, generally each process executes the same program but the work it does depends on it's unique number within all the processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **communicator**: a group of processes that can communicate (a process can be in many different communicators, though in this class we will generally just use a single global communicator).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rank**: the unique identifying number of a process within a communicator. Process ranks run from 0 to the number of processes minus one in the communicator. In general, a processes rank will have a different in each communicator it is a member of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no global memory shared by all the processors. Data must be exchanged with messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All processors operate independently of one another unless synchronization calls are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We often use the terms MPI rank, processor, processes, program instance, etc. interchangeably. A processor/core may have more than one MPI rank running on it but even in this case they are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: Though in principle each process can execute a unique program ((**MPMD: Multiple Program, Multiple Data**)), generally each process executes the same program but the work it does depends on it's unique number within all the processes. This is called **SPMD: Single Program, Multiple Data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocking Vs Non-blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blocking operation**: An MPI communication operation is blocking, if return of control to the calling process indicates that all resources, such as buffers, specified in the call can be reused, e.g., for other operations.  In particular, all state transitions initiated by a blocking operation are completed before control returns to the calling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-blocking operation**: An MPI communication operation is non-blocking, if the corresponding call may return before all effects of the operation are completed and before the resources used by the call can be reused. Thus, a call of a non-blocking operation only starts the operation. The operation itself is completed not before all state transitions caused are completed and the resources specified can be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that a blocking send is **asynchronous** in the sense that continuing execution does not imply that a message has been received by the receiving MPI rank, just that the buffers can be used (e.g., an MPI implementation might make a copy of the data before and then return control to the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Required synchronization is achieved through other \"wait\" calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Setup MPI.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to run MPI instructions in Julia, we first need to [configure MPI.jl](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/stable/configuration/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we need the auxiliary package MPIPreferences.jl. This will (hopefully) detect an MPI implementation library on your system at one of the default locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, launch Julia and in the REPL do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "julia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add(\"MPIPreferences\")\n",
    "\n",
    "julia> using MPIPreferences; MPIPreferences.use_system_binary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to `use_system_binary()` should automatically detect the MPI binary. \n",

    "We will still use MPIPreferences to set up our environment, but this time the call to `use_system_binary()` instead of having an empty default list of arguments, will include the argument `library_names` with the location of where the MPI binary resides on the parallel file system in the cluster.\n",
