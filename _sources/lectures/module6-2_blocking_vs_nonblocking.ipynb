When process B only requests a message with a certain tag number, messages with different tags will be buffered by the network until B is ready for them. \n",

In many cases, we can initialize sends and receives to do some work with data that does _not_ depend on the received data then come back to fix things up once we have the extra data. (This is called _overlapping communication and computation_.)\n",
